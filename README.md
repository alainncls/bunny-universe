This monorepo groups the components of the Bunny Universe points system.  
The system is designed to reward users with $CARROT&nbsp;ü•ï for holding Bunny Universe NFTs and contributing to the Bunny
Universe ecosystem.

## Components

### Subgraph&nbsp;üîé

In the `packages/subgraph` directory, you can find the subgraph that indexes Bunny Universe smart contract events.  
It keeps track of all the events relevant to the points system, specifically the `Transfer` events.

The subgraph is hosted
on [The Graph Studio](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/E99RzE1iK71GUk1qndxGTwZgpqYaF3boA1faZ4pCjrSw?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one).  
You can query it using
the [GraphQL Playground](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/67521/bunny-universe/version/latest).

### Backend&nbsp;‚öôÔ∏è

The backend for the points system API is in the `packages/functions` directory.  
It is hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

It includes two main endpoints:

- `GET /api?address=0x...`: Computes and returns the points of a given address.
- `POST /api-admin`: Computes and updates the scores of all addresses holding Bunny Universe NFTs.

### Dashboard&nbsp;üñ•Ô∏è

The dashboard, located in `packages/dashboard`, displays the points of Bunny Universe users.  
It is hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and accessible
at [earncarrot.bunnyuniverse.xyz](https://earncarrot.bunnyuniverse.xyz/).

Once users connect their wallet, they can view their points, and the leaderboard.  
The dashboard also provides a detailed breakdown of points per NFT.
